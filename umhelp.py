# Unmoderated Queue Helper Bot v.11 by u/BuckRowdy.  This is a script I cobbled together from other bots.
# The bot manages the unmoderated queue and also checks for highly reported items.
# The point of the bot is to automate approving posts that fit a certain profile and removing posts that fit the profile of spam.

#  - If a post is voted below 1 and has two reports it will be removed and a removal reason will be left.  Posts in this category fit the profile of spam.
#  - Submissions reaching 400 upvotes within two hours and without any user reports will be reported so they can be evaluated.

#  - Submissions that are older than 18 hours, have no reports, and have at least one upvote are approved.
#  - Remove downvoted week old posts to clean up the sub's front page.
#  - Approve week old posts that remain at one upvote but don't get reported.
